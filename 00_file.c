/*In C, there are several data types, each with a specific format specifier for input/output operations using functions like printf() and scanf(). Below is a list of the primary data types in C along with their corresponding format specifiers.

Basic Data Types:
Data Type	Description	Size	Format Specifier
int	Integer	Typically 4 bytes	%d or %i
char	Character	1 byte	%c
float	Single-precision floating-point number	Typically 4 bytes	%f
double	Double-precision floating-point number	Typically 8 bytes	%lf
void	No value	N/A	N/A
Extended Data Types (Modifiers):
Data Type	Description	Size	Format Specifier
short int or short	Shortened integer (usually half the size of int)	Typically 2 bytes	%hd
long int or long	Longer integer (greater range than int)	Typically 4 or 8 bytes	%ld
long long int	Even longer integer (used for very large values)	Typically 8 bytes	%lld
unsigned int	Unsigned integer (only positive values)	Typically 4 bytes	%u
unsigned short int	Unsigned short integer	Typically 2 bytes	%hu
unsigned long int	Unsigned long integer	Typically 4 or 8 bytes	%lu
unsigned long long	Unsigned long long integer	Typically 8 bytes	%llu
long double	Extended precision floating-point	Typically 12 or 16 bytes	%Lf
Additional Format Specifiers:
Type	Description	Format Specifier
size_t	Used for sizes (typically unsigned)	%zu
ptrdiff_t	Difference between two pointers	%td
intmax_t	Maximum-width integer	%jd
uintmax_t	Maximum-width unsigned integer	%ju
Special Data Types for Pointers and Characters:
Data Type	Description	Format Specifier
char*	String (pointer to character array)	%s
void*	Pointer to any type	%p
int*, float*, etc.	Pointer to specific types	%p
Special Flags and Format Modifiers:
Field Width and Precision: You can control the width of the output or input with numbers between % and the specifier. For example:

%5d will print an integer in a field of 5 characters wide.
%.2f will print a float with 2 digits after the decimal.
Left Alignment: Use %- to left-align the output within the specified width. For example, %-5d left-aligns the integer.

Example Usage:
c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 10;
    float b = 3.14;
    double c = 1.23456789;
    long long d = 123456789012345;

    printf("int: %d\n", a);          // prints an integer
    printf("float: %.2f\n", b);      // prints a float with 2 decimal places
    printf("double: %lf\n", c);      // prints a double
    printf("long long: %lld\n", d);  // prints a long long integer

    return 0;

why double is used

The double data type in C is used for storing floating-point numbers with double precision. It provides higher precision and a larger range than the float data type, making it useful in situations where you need more accurate or larger floating-point calculations. Here’s why double is used:

Key Reasons for Using double:
Higher Precision:

A double uses 64 bits (8 bytes) to store the value, whereas a float uses 32 bits (4 bytes). This means double can represent numbers with more digits after the decimal point.
The precision of a float is typically around 6-7 decimal places, while a double can handle approximately 15-16 decimal places.
For example:
c
Copy code
float f = 3.1415926535;
double d = 3.1415926535;
printf("float: %.10f\n", f);    // Outputs: 3.1415927410 (approximate)
printf("double: %.10lf\n", d);  // Outputs: 3.1415926535 (more accurate)
Larger Range:

double can store much larger and smaller numbers than float. This is useful in scientific and engineering calculations where you often work with very large or very small values.
A float can typically represent numbers in the range of 10^(-38) to 10^(38), while double can represent numbers in the range of 10^(-308) to 10^(308).
More Accurate Calculations:

When performing complex calculations, using double reduces the risk of rounding errors due to limited precision.
This is particularly important in fields like physics simulations, financial calculations, and other applications where precision is critical.
Standard for Most Math Functions:

In the C standard library, most mathematical functions (e.g., sin(), cos(), sqrt(), etc.) return double values. This is because these functions often require a higher level of precision.
Example:
If you are performing scientific calculations, such as computing the area of a circle with a very precise value of π (pi), you would use double:

c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    double radius = 3.141592653589793;
    double area = 3.141592653589793 * radius * radius;

    printf("Area of circle: %.15lf\n", area);  // Outputs with high precision

    return 0;
}
When to Use double vs float:
Use double when you need more precision or are working with very large/small numbers.
Use float if memory efficiency is a priority (e.g., on devices with limited resources) and precision isn’t critical.
In summary, double is used in C when you need higher precision and a larger range for floating-point numbers compared to float.
